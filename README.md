> Tools for exploring the resource graph of **Assembly Line 2** (PC) and planning efficient factories.

You may consider this package as a Excel sheet with all the relevant information about the building-tree of the game, everything scaled to your current limit of starters and much easier to visualize and to navigate. See 

## Why visualize the factory graph?

### The challenge of late-game planning
High-tier Assembly Line 2 machines intertwine dozens of subassemblies and radioactive refineries. Tracking how many miners, cutters, and makers are required to sustain a target output quickly becomes error prone. Missing a single intermediate recipe can cascade into hours of manual rework.

### How this package helps
AssemblyLine2PC.jl builds a directed recipe graph from the game's data and offers:

- **Material accounting** â€“ traverse the graph and compute raw-resource demand for any item or production rate.
- **Throughput insights** â€“ estimate miner counts and top production speeds with helpers such as `nminers` and `topspeed`.
- **Readable breakdowns** â€“ format recipe tables with PrettyTables, highlight transformers, and surface fuel consumption for radioactive makers.
- **Graph tooling** â€“ leverage `Graphs.jl`/`MetaGraphsNext.jl` utilities for custom analyses or alternative visualizations.

## Quick start

### 1. Install the package
```julia
julia> import Pkg
julia> Pkg.develop("https://github.com/LauraBMo/MinerNumbers.jl.git") # Dependency
julia> Pkg.develop("https://github.com/LauraBMo/AssemblyLine2PC.jl.git")
```

### 2. Inspect a recipe
```julia
julia> using AssemblyLine2PC

julia> tree = datatree();  # build the complete crafting graph

julia> AssemblyLine2PC.cost(tree, "ElectricEngine")  # total raw-material units
```

### 3. Plan production throughput

Naviagate recipe for AI Robot Bomber ("AIRBomber" in [`Data.jl`](https://github.com/LauraBMo/AssemblyLine2PC.jl/blob/main/src/Data.jl)) at max theoretical speed for your given limit of starters:

```julia
julia> using AssemblyLine2PC

julia> VG = viewgraph();

julia> airb = "AIRBomber"
julia> max_miners = 310 + 46*2  # Your starters limit for the job. 

# PrettyTables report showing intermediate makers, pack ratios, and raw demandâ€¦
julia> VG(airb; miners = max_miners)
julia> VG(airb, 4, 6; miners = max_miners)
```

Here some screenshots showing the output.

## Factory graph overview
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    RM[Raw materials] --> TF[Transformers]
    TF --> MK1[Early makers]
    MK1 --> MK2[Advanced makers]
    MK2 --> MK3[Late-game assemblies]
    MK3 --> RAD[Radioactive makers]
    RAD --> Goals[Target item throughput]
    RM -.-> Fuel[Fuel consumption tracking]
    Fuel --> RAD
```

The graph encodes every recipe as a vertex with weighted edges showing ingredient ratios. Transformers (wire, liquid, gear, plate) feed makers, which in turn build late-game robotics and nuclear technology. Fuel requirements are annotated separately so radioactive chains can be planned alongside raw ore demand.
